train set -> use to train and design the model
test set ->  get the best possible estimate of how successful our model
================================================================================
overfitting
-> accuracy in the training set in higher and the accuracy in the test set is lower
-> conditions: training data is abnormally higher (greater than 95%) and accuracy of test data is very low (less than 65%).
-> if its similar, then theyre not overfitting

Precision: The precision of a model describes how many detected items are truly relevant. It is calculated by dividing the true positives by overall positives.
